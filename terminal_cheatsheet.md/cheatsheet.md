# Cheatsheet
>Terminal is the basic level on which you can "talk" to your computer. It doesn't require a GUI. Here's the language we use!

### General terminal commands


* `cd` change directory (takes me somewhere else)
* `ls` list folders and files
  * `ls -l` list folders and files plus attributes
  * `ls -al` list files and folders including hidden
* `~` takes you back to the home directory
* `pwd` print working directory
* `.` current folder
* `..` one folder up
* `open` self-explanatory
* `mv` (+ location) move file, (+ name) rename file
* `cp` (+ location) copy file, (+ name) duplicate file
* `rm` remove/delete (USE WITH CARE!)
  * `-r` recursive - changes/moves/copies/deletes everything in a directory... also use with care ;) 
* `mkdir` create new folder
* `touch` create new file


> Note: White spaces are not your friends as a programmer naming stuff.
> Instead use 'kebab (my-file), 'camel' myFile, 'snake' (my_file) or 'Pascal' (MyFile) when naming files and directories. Make sure not to mix up the different dashes and apostrophes when coding!

### Useful Keys
* `UP` takes you to your prior command
* `Cmd + L` clears your command shell
* `Tab` 'autofills' and lets you search through options within a directory
  


## Git commands

>Git was invented by a Finnish genius to make it easier to work on multiple versions of a complex code repository. GitHub is a cloud storage platform for Git. There are various GUIs that can be used with it but we are doing it old school.
