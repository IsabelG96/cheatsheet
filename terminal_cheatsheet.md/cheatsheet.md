>Terminal is the basic level on which you can "talk" to your computer. It doesn't require a GUI. Here's the language we use!

### General terminal commands

* `mkdir` - create new folder
* `touch` - create new file
* `cd` - change directory (takes me somewhere else)
* `ls` - list folders and files
* `~` - takes you back to the homescreen
